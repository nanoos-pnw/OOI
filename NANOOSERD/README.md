# OOI Platform metadata

JSON files with metadata matching our ERDDAP dataset configurations, and intended for use by NVS and GOA-ON

Given the complexity of these JSON files, it'd be very helpful to implement JSON validation, ideally automatically via CI (Continuous Integration). But that'll take more effort. In the meantime, we can use manually use online validators such as https://jsonformatter.org. For example, for `ce01issm.json` use this url: https://jsonformatter.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce01issm.json. Below are jsonformatter.org links for every file; **click on the link for the edited file to run the validator:**
- [ce01issm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce01issm.json)
- [ce02shsm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce02shsm.json)
- [ce04ossm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce04ossm.json)
- [ce06issm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce06issm.json)
- [ce07shsm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce07shsm.json)
- [ce09ossm.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanoos-pnw/OOI/master/NANOOSERD/ce09ossm.json)
